# Implement a design from scratch

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

### Notes
Important notes with Figma:

* if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
* some values are in float - feel free to round them


Interactions note:

* the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
* links hover/active: #FF6565
* button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
* max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
